The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development offers programs 
that provide homeowners of all income levels with the resources to improve their
 home’s energy efficiency. Our programs can help with insulation, hot water 
 system improvements, furnace repair or replacement, renewable energy systems, and 
 other health and safety enhancements. The department also provides energy efficiency 
 programs specifically for affordable, multifamily rental properties, as well as 
 outreach and training to contractor partners who wish to participate in our programs
  for residential and small commercial projects. ​​​​
